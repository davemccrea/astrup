# ECG Player Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive unit and integration tests for the ECG Player JavaScript module.

- Responsive canvas sizing

**Key Test Cases:**
- Three-layer canvas setup (background, waveform, QRS flash)
- Proper canvas scaling for high-DPI displays
- Canvas cleanup on component destruction
- Responsive dimension calculations


## Test Utilities (`/test/utils/test-helpers.js`)

### Mock Data Generators
- `createMockECGData(options)`: Generates synthetic ECG data with configurable parameters
- `createMockBehaviorSubject(initialValue)`: Creates RxJS BehaviorSubject with spy methods
- `createMockFormElement(type, value)`: Creates mock DOM form elements

### Canvas & Animation Mocking
- `createMockCanvas(width, height)`: Creates mock Canvas with 2D context
- `mockAnimationFrame()`: Provides controlled animation frame testing
- `mockTime(startTime)`: Time manipulation utilities for consistent testing

### RxJS Testing Utilities
- `collectEmissions(observable, count)`: Collects multiple emissions from observables
- `waitForEmission(observable)`: Waits for single emission from observable

### ECG-Specific Helpers
- `createMockECGPlayerContext()`: Sets up ECG player test context
- Synthetic ECG signal generation with configurable heart rate and lead count
- QRS detection simulation for testing timing accuracy

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests (Vitest)
```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:unit:watch

# Run with coverage report
npm run test:unit:coverage

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:unit:ui
```


## Test Configuration

### Vitest Configuration (`vitest.config.js`)
- **Environment**: jsdom for DOM simulation
- **Globals**: Enabled for describe/it/expect without imports
- **Coverage**: Text, JSON, and HTML reports
- **Setup**: Automatic mock setup for Canvas API and DOM


## Best Practices

### Writing Unit Tests
1. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on others
2. **Mocking**: Use provided mock utilities for external dependencies
3. **Coverage**: Aim for both positive and negative test cases
4. **Naming**: Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior


### Mock Usage
1. **Canvas API**: Use provided canvas mocks for rendering tests
2. **RxJS Streams**: Use BehaviorSubject mocks for reactive state
3. **Time**: Use time mocking utilities for animation testing
4. **ECG Data**: Use synthetic data generators for consistent testing

## Performance Considerations

### Unit Test Performance
- Mocks are lightweight and don't perform actual rendering
- Time manipulation allows fast testing of time-dependent behavior
- Parallel test execution where possible


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Canvas Mock Errors**: Ensure canvas setup is called in beforeEach
2. **Timing Issues**: Use appropriate waits and time mocking
3. **RxJS Subscription Leaks**: Always complete subjects in afterEach

### Debug Strategies
1. **Unit Tests**: Use `console.log` and Vitest's debug mode
2. **Coverage Reports**: Identify untested code paths
3. **Test Isolation**: Run individual tests to isolate issues

## Contributing

When adding new features to the ECG Player:

1. **Add Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and logic
2. **Update Mocks**: Extend mock utilities if needed
3. **Update Documentation**: Keep this README current
4. **Verify Coverage**: Ensure adequate test coverage for new code

## Test Data

The test suite uses synthetic ECG data generated with realistic characteristics:
- 12-lead standard ECG configuration
- Configurable sampling rates (typically 500Hz)
- Synthetic QRS complexes with accurate timing
- Realistic amplitude ranges and noise patterns

This approach ensures consistent, reproducible testing without requiring actual patient data.
